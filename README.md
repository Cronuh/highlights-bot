# Twitch Highlights Bot
This is just a project I started for fun after seeing many popular YouTube channels appear that make compilation videos from popular Twitch clips.
This task could be easily executed by the computer in my eyes, so I started working on a program that does exactly that:
it automatically collects trending clips from twitch, edits them together to make gaming highlight videos, and uploads them to YouTube.
The project is still under development and far from finished, so this README will probably not be updated until the first prototype works as expected.
